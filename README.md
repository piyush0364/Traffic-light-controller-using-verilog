# Traffic-light-controller-using-verilog
Done Verilog Implementation of Digital Circuit Designs on FPGA.The aim of the project is to design a traffic controller for a T-intersection. The six cases present here eventually turn to the six states. From state diagram, we got state table.The finite state machine used here is moore machine.
